A tower defense game showcasing the effects of evolution and natural selection.

An alien race will send some number of their population across the screen in waves, and you're placing different types of tower defenses (machine guns, flamethrowers, etc.) to stop as many of them as possible. Aliens can have many different properties (speed, health, fire resistance, size, color, etc.), and some will naturally be better suited to getting past your defenses than others.

Any aliens that make it across the screen successfully have survived to re-enter the Alien population. After a wave is complete, a new generation of Aliens are born by pairing off the Alien population to produce offspring. Each pair creates a new Alien based on their properties, plus any random mutations.

The player wins if they can reduce the Alien population to zero before the forces of evolution render the defenses ineffective, allowing the Alien population to grow out of control.
